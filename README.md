## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

🧠 **Learning Log:** I'm using this repo as a learning diary to track everything I study, code, or experiment with related to deep learning.

📁 **Organized Storage:** This will store Jupyter notebooks, code snippets, and concept explanations as I go through different tutorials, courses, and challenges.

🧪 **Practice and Progress:** You’ll find messy code, broken experiments, and also improvements over time — this is part of the process.
